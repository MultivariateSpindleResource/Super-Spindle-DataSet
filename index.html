          <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/heald/people.html">Heald Lab has been around for a while... </a><br>
          <br>
          And as cell biologists tend to do, we generate a lot of <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/heald/index.html"> imaging </a> data. As we were going through the many hard drives of our images, we wondered - how could we make it <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openscience&src=typd">#open</a> to the general research community? How not to let it disappear as so much primary data do? <br>
          <br>
          And then, there were the daily concerns many of us face...
          <br>
          <br>
          Sometimes it is not really obvious, whether the treatment we apply results in a phenotype. 
          <br><br>
          Sometimes it is not really obvious, what to measure to even detect it. 
          <br><br>
          Sometimes we are worried that we see, what we want to see but is not there. Or that we are missing, what is. 
          <br><br>
          Out of all these considerations, this project was born. <br>
          <br>
          With this publication we would like to share the thousands of images we collected over the past ~5 years, as well as propose a solution, which allows to quantify multiple characteristics about the captured spindle objects. We also suggest some analysis approaches, to help narrow down potential metrics (features/variables) of interest. We are basically presenting here a biological big (or medium) data-driven hypothesis generator, an exploratory one, which should help launch cell biologists onto new research tracks.
