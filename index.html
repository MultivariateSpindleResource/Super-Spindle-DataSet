          <p>
          <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/heald/people.html">Heald Lab</a> has been around for a while... <br>
          <br>
          And as cell biologists do, we tend to generate a lot of <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/heald/index.html"> imaging </a> data.<br>
          <br>
          As we were going through the many hard drives of our images, we wondered - "how could we make it open to the general research community?". This is how this project was born. <br>
          <br>
          With this publication we would like to share the thousands of images we collected over the past ~5 years, as well as propose a solution, which allows to quantify multiple characteristics about the captured spindle objects. We also suggest some analysis approaches, to help in narrowing down potential metrics (features/variables) of interest. We are basically presenting here a biological big (or medium) data-driven hypothesis generator, which should help launching cell biology researchers onto new project tracks.
